			<p>It is on hard surfaces and, although there are some steps, these can be avoided.  </p>

            <p>Knaresborough was first mentioned in the Domesday Book (1086) and granted to Hugh de Moreville in 1158 
			(one of the murderers of Thomas Becket) and then to William de Stuteville in 1173.</p>
			<p>It has a castle, which overlooks the river Nidd.  The castle dates back to the 12th century and, indeed, 
			Hugh de Moreville took refuge there after his involvement in the murder of Becket.  
			Many changes and modernisations of the castle took place over the next 4 centuries. </p>
			<p>After the nearby Battle of Marston Moor in 1644, Cromwell ordered the castle to be demolished and 
			hence there is very little left today. </p>
			<p>What is left is because the local people petitioned parliament to ask for some of it to be left as a prison.</p>
			<p>In the late 18th century, a cotton mill was built next to the river, hence the weir, and in the 19th century 
			Knaresborough was famous for its linen production.</p>

			Knaresborough and we will see a number on the walk. </p>
			<p>The buildings of Knaresborough feature numerous windows, 
			which were blocked up to avoid the window tax, which existed from 1696 to 1851, and gave rise to the expression 
			'Daylight Robbery'. The paintings cover these blocked up windows using the technique of trompe l'oeil 
			(to fool the eye) making the images appear real.</p>
			<p>They celebrate local people and events and this one is of Guy Fawkes, attempting to blow up parliament in 1605.  
			Fawkes, born in York, lived for many years in Scotton, a village near Knaresborough, where a pub is named after him, 
			and would have visited Knaresborough on numerous occasions.</p>
